I then found an interesting paper for which I could find no implementations online, and the thing went from &quot;let&#x27;s implement this paper&quot; to getting pretty obsessed with the whole thing.<p>It&#x27;s at an early, eaaaarly stage. There&#x27;s a lot of work to be done, and it&#x27;s a memory hog, but generally speaking works quite well, and the output is for the most part very high quality, so I&#x27;m happy to share it as beta.",
